# Some Thoughts regarding the LogU IOTA Implementation

The LogU IOTA Implementation for analyzing Supply Chain Problems is driven by new developments in the IOTA World. Here are some thoughts and ToDo's to keep up with their pace of new technologies.

## Current Development:

* MAM didn't work constantly as it had many timeouts and errors even with correct or example-implementations
* Switch from MAM to ZeroValue-Transactions in the actual IOTA Devnet - the message is public at the moment but can be encrypted later. Current Scripts can be found @ prototype/ZVT.
* At the same time: Have a Look on IOTA Streams as it will be the next [MAM with nice features](https://blog.iota.org/iota-streams-alpha-7e91ee326ac0)
* Documentation and Diagrams are to be made
* RasPi Network with Web Status Page
